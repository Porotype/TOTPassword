# Vaadin TOTP example

This is an example app demonstrating a [TOTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) implementation in [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) app. The example works with e.g. [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) app that can be installed to iOS or Android. The source code for the server side implementation is available [from GitHub](https://github.com/Porotype/TOTPassword).
